# PFDAM_Junk_Game

Junk is a small 2D roguelike game that I developed in 50 hours for my final project as a Cross-Platform Application Developer student in 2022 using Unity.The main mechanics are very simple, there is a player that you can move up, down, left, right and diagonally and automatically shoot in the direction you are looking, all you have to do is survive the different enemies that follow you and try to kill you.
